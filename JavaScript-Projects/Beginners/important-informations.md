# The classLists object properties like add(), remove(), toggle(), contains()

One thing to note is that classLists object is used mostly to add CSS to the selected class using JS but we can also use it add a class to an element for JS and HTML purpose too.

Sometimes using toggle() or add/remove() is by choice or dependent on the logic of the code and other times some other considerations. contains is used to check if the selected element has a specific class or not and then used to perform an opertation. Useful if a class is already added or not. Used to enforce an if statement depending on a classList.

# HOW IMPORTANT ARE YOUR VARIABLES AND WHAT CAN WE DO WITH THEM
We use our variables or even values to perform anything as long as it is allowed. Think of it as a person. When declared it can be used to write a logic to check itself or write logic to check other variables.
