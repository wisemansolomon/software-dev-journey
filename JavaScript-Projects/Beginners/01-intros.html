      // The = sign is for assigning values to a variable. Variable re-assignment means re-assigning an already assigned variable a different value. let allows us to do that but const does not. So
      // if we have a variable initially declared with const that over the course of writing the program will need to change its initial value, we can go back and change the declaration to let. Sometimes
      //we may not know this from the onset, but as our code grows bigger
