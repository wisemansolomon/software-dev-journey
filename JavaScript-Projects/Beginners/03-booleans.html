      /* Booleans are a data type in JS that can only either of two values "true" or "false" One of the importance of the boolean is
      they help us in programming write logical programs i.e if-Statements: If statements lets us do two things, 1. we can write multiple program logic and 2. decide which one to run
      depending on certain conditions. In this program, we shall learn some shortcuts too.

      Operators: operators are special symbols or keywords that perform specific operation on one, two, or more variables, values or expressions. They help us manipulate data, make decisions and control the flow of our programs.
              In the course of programming, we will need to employ operators often times. They are of three types, 1. Arithmetic, 2. Comparison Operators and 3. Logical Operators.
              Arithmetic: +,-, *, /, %,**   % is for modulus: They perform mathematical operations on numbers
              Comparison: ==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <= : They compare values, in pure state or as a variable and return a boolean result. Rarely will compare booleans
              Logical Operators: AND(&&), OR(||), NOT(!): It is used to evaluate two or more sides of a boolean expressions. (NOT operator only works with 1 boolean expression/value. It flips it)
      Note: == tries to convert the values to be compared into the same type, hence it is known as loose equality /'type' coercion AND comparison operators are lower in priority than math operators.
              In JavaScript though, there are additional operators that do not fit neatly into these three categories.
              * Assignment Operators: (=, +=, -=, *=, /= etc)
              * Bitwise Operators: (&, |, ^, ~, <<,>> etc)
              * Conditional (Tenary) Operator: (? :)
              * Comma Operator (,)
              * Unary Operators (typeof, delete (to delete a property from an object), void)
              * Spread Operator (...)
             Additionally, JS has some quirks (specific behavior exhibited only under certain conditions) when it comes to operators
             1. JS will tend to automatically convert values to the correct 'type' (not always what we want though so we must be careful) when using some operators.
             2. JS looks at values through the lens of truthy and falsy if encountered in a boolean context- in conditional statements or logical operators.
             i. Truthy All non zero numbers (-/+), true, non empty strings ("hi", " "), Objects (empty or not) eg {}, new Date(), Arrays(empty or not)
             ii. Falsy: false, 0, empty string (""), null, undefined, NaN   //undefined is variable declared without assigning a value and only by using let. to use const we must then assign the variable with value 'undefined'

            //Shortcuts where possible is great for efficient code. truthy and falsy values concept in JS has helped programmers to identify shortcuts to a much longer code logic
            // for example, the shortcut is not a alternate way to write if statements because we sitll use if-else

            the !NOT operator on a value checks the truthy or falsy nature of that value. If on a variable, it evalates its value and used to check the opposite state of that value.
