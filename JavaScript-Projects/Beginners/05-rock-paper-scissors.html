        If we have to write almost the same exact block of code more than once in our program, it is a good idea to use a function for it.

       Less Efficient way: in which we did not return a value but modified a global variable using a function. This happened because the skeletal framework was an if statement.

      let computerMove = ""; //this variable is global/not scoped./ May run into data corruption, someone may assign computerMove to a different value or even change it to const and
      // then the function will not work fine. It is always better where possible to encapsulate data within a function ie use return values. That way, the function will give you the
      // desired output everytime. Basically, we are sayin that keeping data (variables) scoped helps us to prevent naiming conflict like if someone re-assigns our variable.

        const randomNumber = Math.random();

      //Most times in programming, it is useful to break things down to smaller problems and as yourself how one small problem fits into another small problem until
      //everything fits nicely but importantly, approach each small probelm as if it is an either an input to the next small probblem or already a given in. For example
      //The if statement logic is something like, if(name===Solomon),if(age===5){`he is solomon Peters`} else if(age === 30){'he is solomon Ojiako'}
      //if(born male) then if(age === 0 to 12){child} else if(age > 12){teenager} elseif(age > 18){adult}. So we can see that in programming, not all variables are given,
      //some are derivative of some logic like generateComputerMove() while some will be direclty provided like (playerMove.) And we run some logic if a variable is something or not.

      //If we look at the overall game from a bird's eye view perspective, we can see that the steps of clicking the button and some logic runs is similar to
      // a case of if you click button a, this happens else if click button b, that happens happens and if we click button c, then one other thing happens and
      // in all these cases, a b or c have been assigned a value that will either be passed as a function or input in some way for any one of them to be true.
      //That idea can be used to write a global function and an if within an if. Where the parent if true, executes the chidren if-else statements. So the child
      //if executes only if parent if is true.So here we pass a value to our function, and we say, if this value is what it is, then line up several if-else statements for that if.
      //So also, the else if, we can line up if... and so on. Always also think of your problems with an assumed ifs. E.g, initially we did onclick run some logic to get random values.
      //we later assumed if the range is split in 3 parts and we assigned move to each part and we called that move computerMove. Also note that we can actually use a an array for the
      //computerMove and randomly pick a move from the array and assign it as computerMove. That works too
